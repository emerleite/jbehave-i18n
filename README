== Licence

See LICENSE.txt for details.

== Notes
   - Java 5 and early uses ISO8859-1 to load a properties file, so you need to use this encoding in your
   keywords.properties to things work properly. If you need, use Unicode code points to represent some chars not supported by ISO8859-1.
   Future versions will avoid you of this hell.

   - jbehave-i18n have only been tested with United States English and Brasilian Portuguese, so if you have
   problems with your language, contact me. First, try Unicode code points :)
